# SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker (CAT) v4.0.0

This time, in *rails*.

We built up the third version of the CAT in Flask, before I really understood how MVC worked, what web frameworks were for, and some other best practices.

Since launch, CATv3 has run into a ton of predictable problems which would be completely solved had it been built properly, which I can accomplish quickly and to a higher degree of excellence in Rails.

So CATv4 will be a quick rebuild in Rails, and should be the final application moving forward.
