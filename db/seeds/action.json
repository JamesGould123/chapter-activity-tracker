At this event we outlined our plans for the year ahead, and sought feedback from students. At the EGM we held elections for members to join our committee. We elected 9 new members to our committee who all confirmed they support the mission of SSDP to see reform to Drug Policy. Furthermore our new members expressed passion in seeing our harm-reduction campaign for the year ahead come to fruition. We have now publicly committed to a rigorous year of promoting harm-reduction policies for the year ahead. Also mentioned at the EGM by our Chairperson was that next year (April-May 2019) we will engage with local city and county councillors to adopt a pro-harm reduction stance when running for council elections which are set to take place in Summer 2019.

        "note": "On November 15th our chapter and the CIT chapter of SSDP held a fundraiser event of stand-up comedy with different comedians from around Ireland. The theme of the night was drug policy as the event was to raise funds to support UCC SSDP and CIT SSDP in acquiring harm reduction materials for students to give out on our campuses as we continue our campaigns to see our colleges introduce a program for the student unions to be allowed distribute testing-kits and better harm reduction education for students.

The Harm Reduction education has proved successful, with every freshers park first year received this August (start of semester) containing harm reduction leaflets and cards we approve of. Our SU have adopted a more harm reduction based approach to any drug related issues. We are helping them in their campaign to see testing-kits be provided with students right now. ",
