At this event we outlined our plans for the year ahead, and sought feedback from students. At the EGM we held elections for members to join our committee. We elected 9 new members to our committee who all confirmed they support the mission of SSDP to see reform to Drug Policy. Furthermore our new members expressed passion in seeing our harm-reduction campaign for the year ahead come to fruition. We have now publicly committed to a rigorous year of promoting harm-reduction policies for the year ahead. Also mentioned at the EGM by our Chairperson was that next year (April-May 2019) we will engage with local city and county councillors to adopt a pro-harm reduction stance when running for council elections which are set to take place in Summer 2019.
